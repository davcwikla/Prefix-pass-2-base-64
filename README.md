 PrefixPass2Base64

While hacking THM  room called "Hijacking" I had to do script who add prefix to password and encoding entire paswords in file to Base64. After done this room I though that good idea will be update this script and do this better. 

If u have passwords list and all passwords start from the new line and u need to add prefix automatically for example: admin:password where "admin:" is directly prefix and in next step u need to encoded it in Base64 this script is 4u. Fell free to use this.
